**Career Readiness Reflection – Bootcamp Checkpoint**

I feel motivated and ready to take the next step in my career path. During this bootcamp, I’ve built a solid foundation in full-stack web development and improved both my technical and problem-solving skills. I’m becoming more confident in my ability to learn independently, debug issues, and work on real projects.

Some of the main skills I gained include:

* Understanding how to build full-stack applications (front-end and back-end)
* Working with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB
* Structuring projects and writing cleaner, more organized code
* Using Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration
* Improving my logic, research skills, and ability to learn new tools quickly

This bootcamp helped me realize that consistency and practice are key. I still have things I want to improve, especially building more complex projects, strengthening my problem-solving speed, and becoming even more comfortable with real-world development workflows.

Overall, I feel ready to continue learning, building projects, and moving forward toward a professional role as a web developer. I’m excited about the next phase of my journey and committed to growing both technically and personally.
